# StockML-TF
Tensorflow JS implementation under NodeJS for server side applications, with simple HTTP API for remote control

# Install:
```
- npm install
```

# HTTP API
- GET http://localhost:3000/model_name/shapes // Input and Output tensor shapes for training and Input useable for prediction
- GET http://localhost:3000/model_name/status // Loaded,Training,Ready when it is Ready your Model is ready for accept prediction
- POST http://localhost:3000/model_name/predict + {input: your_data} // Accept data for prediction/evaluation and response the result

# Available modells:
- Rnn
- LSTM
- LSTM with Cells

# What we are looking for:
- Smma cross(SAwesome oscillator) indicated trades predict with classification method Good/Bad (An avarage good trade on the picture below)
![example chart](https://github.com/stockmlbot/NodeTFJS/blob/master/readme/example.jpg)

# Results:
- AO,Trix,Mome     -> lstm_hidden_cells with 3x50 Epoch: loss=0.0812 val_loss=0.0822
- AO,Trix,Mome,RSI -> lstm_hidden_cells with 3x50 Epoch: loss=0.0817 val_loss=0.0742


# Example data structure:
- Useable for utils.js -> trade_singal_extractor(name, indicator_count)

- trade_history_ao_mome_trix, 3 // indicator count = 3
- trade_history_ao_mome_trix_rsi, 4 // indicator count = 4
